*glTF 2.0 SDK for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.*

<!-- NOTICE: This section is duplicated in docs/INDEX.md. Please keep them in sync. -->

glTF-Transform supports reading, editing, and writing 3D models in glTF 2.0 format. Unlike 3D modeling tools â€”Â which are ideal for artistic changes to geometry, materials, and animation â€” glTF-Transform provides fast, reproducible, and lossless control of the low-level details in 3D model. These traits make it a good choice for bundling, splitting, or optimizing an existing model. It can also be used to apply quick fixes for common issues, to build a model procedurally, or to easily develop custom extensions on top of the glTF format. Because the core SDK is compatible with both Node.js and Web, glTF-Transform may be used to develop offline workflows and web applications alike.

glTF-Transform is modular, and can be used in several ways:

- `@gltf-transform/core`: Core SDK, providing an expressive API to read, edit, and write glTF files.
- `@gltf-transform/cli`: Command-line interface to apply any available transform to a glTF file.
- `@gltf-transform/*`: Growing collection of transforms, written using the core API, that modify glTF files.

To get started, head over to the [documentation]().

Several existing projects provide complementary functionality to that of glTF-Transform:

- [glTF-Pipeline](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-pipeline/), by AGI, can pack and unpack variations of the glTF format (which glTF-Transform also does) and can apply Draco compression to mesh geometry (which glTF-Transform currently does not, in order to remain portable across both Node.js and Web). While glTF-Pipeline also offers APIs to develop custom pipelines, those APIs are currently less expressive than glTF-Transform's. Because glTF-Pipeline is nearly lossless, it is a good option for applying Draco compression to models produced by glTF-Tranform. glTF-Pipeline does not run in web browsers.
- [meshoptimizer / gltfpack](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer), by [@zeux](https://github.com/zeux), is an excellent tool for optimizing glTF files, and offers far better performance tuning than anything I'll ever write. It is not, however, a general-purpose SDK, and is best used for final optimizations to models produced by glTF-Transform and other tools. gltfpack does not run in web browsers.
- [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf), by [@jkuhlmann](https://github.com/jkuhlmann), and [glTF-Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/glTF-Toolkit), by Microsoft, provide native SDKs for glTF. If JavaScript/TypeScript don't fit your needs, try these.
