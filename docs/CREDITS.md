# Credits

The glTF-Transform project is developed and maintained by [Don McCurdy](https://github.com/donmccurdy). I'm grateful to the individuals who have supported the project through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/donmccurdy/) or by [contributing to the codebase](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/graphs/contributors). Both types of support are vital for helping any Open Source Software (OSS) to continue.

Additional thanks to the following supporters:

- [The Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/), for funding support of XMP metadata
